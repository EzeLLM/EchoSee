## Introduction

EchoSee isn't just another voice assistantâ€”it's a leap forward in AI-powered home automation. Utilizing state-of-the-art LLMs, EchoSee aims to surpass the capabilities of traditional assistants like Alexa and Google Home. With EchoSee, you'll not only experience voice-based interactions but also complex actions performed by LLM agents. In the future, EchoSee will even be able to "see" through a camera, adding another layer of interactive capability.

## Features

- **LLM Integration**: Incorporates advanced LLMs for more natural, nuanced conversations.
- **Multi-Model Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Supports light, mid, heavy, and API-based TTS operations.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: High-accuracy STT using local or Groq-based models.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with new features like camera integration.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and performance tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.10
- pip (Python package installer)
- Access to Groq API (With future ollama and vllm support this will be optional)
- Access to amazon aws free tier (Optional, required in api mode. In case of lack of gpu, api mode is recommended.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/EchoSee.git
    cd EchoSee
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file for sensitive data (e.g., Groq API keys):
    ```plaintext
    GROQAPI=your_groq_api_key
    AWSKEYID=your_aws_access_key_id
    AWSSECRETKEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
    ```
